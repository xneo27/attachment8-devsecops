# Millennium Corporation - Approach

## Agile Architecture/Technical Approach (Processes, Team, and Roles)
In the "*Development Software Process for Millennium Corporation*" document, you will find the typical process we follow. However, because of a short timeframe, we modified it slightly to accommodate.

**Our Process**

We followed a 2-week sprint (modified because of extension). We used the first day to decide if we could achieve this task in the timeframe. The second day, we started planning. We planned for a total of 1 day before starting our sprint. Roles were fairly straightforward for us, the roles defined in the RFP was the same roles used by our team.

**1st Couple Days**

 The first days after planning were brainstorming. We spend 1-day brainstorming ideas of each part of the project and innovation ways to achieve the goals in the timeframe. We wrote those ideas down on the whiteboard. After brainstorming, we started development.
 
**Development**

Usually, we follow a Scrum process, however, here we decided on Kanban. This would give us the flexibility we needed for the short timeframe.
We used Github as our repository of choice, which was a requirement in Attachment 8 document. We follow the Gitflow standard for branching strategies for code integration.
Typically, we use the Atlassian Suite for most everything (i.e. JIRA, Bitbucket, Confluence, Crucible, etc..) but in this project, we used the boards provided by Github to have a way for the evaluators to view our tasks and progress.
All code has to be approached by a pull request. Our standard is someone other than the developers working on the code to approve the pull request.

**Sprint Review**

On the Friday before submission, we performed a sprint review with the Business Development team. We went through each requirement,  checked off each item in Attachment8. We demoed the code to them as well as discussed documentation and other aspects of the project.

**Sprint Retro**

Once the project has been submitted, we will perform a sprint retrospective. We will cover the areas that we would like to improve for the next challenge and what we did well during the challenge. We will strategize on how we could perform this challenge better the next time.
Notes
Just to note, our typical process can be viewed in the "*Other Document*" section below.
