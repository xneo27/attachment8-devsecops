## Instructions for Deploying the Solution
To execute builds, add appropriate variables to terraform.tfvars (see variables.tf for a list of mandatory variables), 
then execute build  using

```
sh start.sh
```

This will pull down associated git branches, initialize terraform, then apply terraform.


Terraform and Packer (both from HashiCorp) should be installed in order to deploy

AWS CLI should be installed and configured prior to use.

A Registered domain is expected for the project and should be configured in terraform.tfvars
